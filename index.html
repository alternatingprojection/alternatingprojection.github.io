<p>We present a novel solution to the problem of local-ization of MEG and EEG brain signals. The solution is sequentialand iterative, and is based on minimizing the least-squares (LS)criterion by the Alternating Projection (AP) algorithm, which iswell  known  in  the  context  of  array  signal  processing.  Unlikeexisting  scanning  solutions  belonging  to  the  beamformer  andmultiple-signal classification (MUSIC) families, the algorithm hasgood  performance  in  low  signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR)  and  cancope  with  closely  spaced  sources  and  any  mixture  of  correlatedsources.  Results  from  simulated  and  experimental  MEG  datafrom  a  real  phantom  demonstrated  superior  localization  thanpopular  scanning  methods  across  an  extended  SNR  range,  theentire inter-source correlation range, and across multiple sources.
