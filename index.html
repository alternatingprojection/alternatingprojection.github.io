<h1>Localization of MEG and EEG Brain Signals by Alternating Projection</h1>

<p><div>We present a novel solution to the problem of local-ization of MEG and EEG brain signals. The solution is sequential and iterative, and is based on minimizing the least-squares (LS) criterion by the Alternating Projection (AP) algorithm, which is well  known  in  the  context  of  array  signal  processing.  Unlike existing  scanning  solutions  belonging  to  the  beamformer  and multiple-signal classification (MUSIC) families, the algorithm has good  performance  in  low  signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR)  and  can cope  with  closely  spaced  sources  and  any  mixture  of  correlated sources.  Results  from  simulated  and  experimental  MEG  data from  a  real  phantom  demonstrated  superior  localization  than popular  scanning  methods  across  an  extended  SNR  range,  the entire inter-source correlation range, and across multiple sources.
